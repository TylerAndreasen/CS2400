# CS2400 Computer Organization

This repo was created to back up my code files from my CS2400 Computer Organization Class.
The included code is mostly if not entirely ARM v7 Assembly Code run in the [CPUlator Computer System Simulator](https://cpulator.01xz.net/).

If you want to try out the code, select **Architecture** -> `ARMv7`, and **System** -> `ARMv7 generic` when starting the simulator.
